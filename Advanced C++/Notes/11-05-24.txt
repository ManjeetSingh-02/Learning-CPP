Dynamic Memory Allocation -
                        C =>
                            Allocation - malloc() function, calloc() function, realloc() function
                            Deallocation - free() function
                        C++ =>
                            Allocation - new operator
                            Deallocation - delete operator

                        int *p = new int;
                        Stack => p having heap address of 786
                        Heap => 786 stored here pointed by p

                        datatype pointer_name = new datatype - int *p = new int;
                        datatype pointer_name = new datatype(initial value) - int *p = new int(4);
                        datatype pointer_name = new datatype[array_size] - int *p = new int[4]; -------> This will create continious memory allocation in HEAP as DYNAMIC ARRAY
