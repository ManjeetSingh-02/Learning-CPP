Error Handling -
    Error means bug in the program
    Some error will not allow the program to run and some error will allow the program to run
    When program is terminated abnormally, that is known as EXCEPTION
    Error can be removed but exceptions cannot be removed, it can only be handled by EXCEPTION HANDLING
    On the basis of type of execution, we face some errors

    Types -
            [+] Compile Time Error(Syntax Error & Semantic Error) - Compiler will check syntax and semantic rules
                                                                    int arr{3};  <--- Syntax Error
                                                                    int arr[-2]; <--- Semantic Error

            [+] Linker/Linking Error - It will occur at time of linking of files and memory

            [+] Loader/Loading Error - It will occur when memory is full

            [+] Run Time Error - An error that occur at the time of execution of the program and this error is called EXCEPTION

            [+] Logical Error - This error will not stop program's compilation and execution but due to logical error, output might be improper
