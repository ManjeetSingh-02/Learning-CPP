Polymorphism
    One of OOPS concept
    Concept is - One Thing Many Forms
    One object can behave differently in different situations
    
Types of Polymorphism
    Compile Time Polymorphism
    Run Time Polymorphism

Compile Time Polymorphism / Compile Time Binding / Static Binding / Early Binding / Static Linking
    Implemented by overloading(Constructor or Method or Operator overloading)
    In this function definition is bind with function call in compile time
    Constant Overloading
    Function Overloading
    Operator Overloading

Run Time Polymorphism / Run Time Binding / Dynamic Binding / Late Binding / Dynamic Linking
    Implemented by overwriting(VIRTUAL Keyword)
    In this function definition is bind with function call in run time

In case of pre and post increment operator overloading, we need to pass `int` as an argument in post-increment
