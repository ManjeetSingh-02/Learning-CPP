Class is a collection of data & methods

Class can have 2 types of members:
    Non - Static:
        Non - Static Data / Instance Data
        Non - Static Function
    Static:
        Static Data / Class Data
        Static Function


No memory will be allocated to the members of the class, when its just created
On creating object, non-static members will gets its memory allocation
Non-Static members will gets its memory every time a new instance is created
Static members will gets its memory one time when class is created & they will be shared among all objects


Z Rule:
    Static Method can access Static Data & Methods
    Non - Static Method can access both Static, Non - Static Data & Methods
