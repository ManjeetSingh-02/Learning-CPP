Abstraction - Incomplete
Concrete - Complete


When a class has atleast one abstract method then it is called as Incomplete or Abstract Class
class A ------------------> Concrete Class or Complete Class
{
public:

    void mylogic() // Concrete Function or Complete Function
    {
        cout << "My Logic" << endl;
    }
};
class A ------------------> Abstract Class or Incomplete Class
{
public:
    virtual void logic() = 0; // Abstract Function or Incomplete Function
};


Any function that is virtual and it is assigned 0 as a body is called PURE VIRTUAL FUNCTION
virtual void logic() = 0; -----------> This is PURE VIRTUAL FUNCTION


We can create pointer of Abstract/Incomplete Class but we cannot create object of Abstract/Incomplete Class
